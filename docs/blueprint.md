## Original User Request:
make a well modular chat popup that i can integrate into any react website so that it pops up a chat box that has a button to make it go full screen, and crawls the webpage. make a nice colour pallete. This app essentially is a chatgpt wrapper that will work in context of only specific web page like a chat bot.
